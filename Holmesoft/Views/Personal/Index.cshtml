                        I enjoy using technology to create solutions to business problems.
                        I love the excitement and feeling of accomplishment that comes from successfully releasing a project.
                        Throughout my career I have been exposed to new languages, processes, frameworks, patterns, and platforms.
                        I have embraced those opportunities to add new skills and understanding to my portfolio.

                    <p>
                        I have provided solutions across multiple computer disciplines. Many times those responsibilities overlapped.
                        My career began at a smaller firm acquired by OppenheimerFunds, and our technology department did not have the
                        finer delineation of roles that a larger firm normally would. As a result, I have experience with application development,
                        website creation and administration, database administration and development, Active Directory and
                        Windows server administration, and network configuration.

                <div class="col text-about">
                    <p>
                        After the firm became more tightly integrated into our parent organization,
                        my responsibilities shifted more exclusively towards a lead developer role. 
                        I began working with different teams within the organization and was consistently exposed to new technologies in the process. 
                        All of this experience led to my most recent role as manager of our client reporting team where  
                        I have been a hands-on manager for the last 3 1/2 years of my career. 
                        I have been guiding the team while continuing as a lead developer to provide solutions ranging
                        from complex individual contributions to participating in group projects.
                        As a manager, I have enjoyed the opportunity to help my team find ways to grow their own skillsets
                        and position them for their future success.
